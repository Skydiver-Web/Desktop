# STEPS
1. Type this command into your terminal tab and press enter:  ```chmod +x install.sh```
2. After type this command into your terminal tab and press enter:  ```./install.sh```
3. Wait for everything to process. After, your terminal tab should have a installer. Click the green button that says Install, then scroll down and click Install Now.
4. Lastly, wait until the app is finished installing. After you will get a notification on the bottom right that says open in browser. Click on that and now you have your own Virtual Machine for free. If the app stops working, delete the -3000.app from the url and visit the project again. Click on Restart Codespace and wait a minute for it to start. You will get a notification again in the bottom right that says Open In Browser. Click on that and you have your app again.
